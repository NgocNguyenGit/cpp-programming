## Mid-term Project
Write a C++ program to multiply and then evaluate two polynomials of an arbitrary degree provided by the user. Up to five variables are possible in each polynomial, ex. (10x^10)(15.5y^3)(1.76z^7)(34p^2)(15f^4)+(4y^4)(4p).
You are allowed to use power and sqrt functions from C++ standard library along with all input/output libraries (iostream and like so). Other functions/methods are required to be implemented by you. You must follow the object-oriented pattern provided by C++ (using the concept of classes and information hiding at least).
Your program should have an adequate user interface (text or graphical), which helps the user to understand and conveniently provides the inputs and understand the output. Employing a graphical user interface is not required, but if implemented, it will get a bonus.
The originality of the source code is also of high importance, and plagiarism detection software may apply. After submitting your project, we will have an online or in-person meeting to get more information on the process of developing your program and the level of your programming skills.

## Homework 2
A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
The salespeople each receive 150€ per week plus 12% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells 6000€ worth of chemicals in a week receives 150€ plus 12% of 6000€, or a total of 870€. Develop a C++ program that uses a while statement to input each salesperson’s gross sales for last week and calculates and displays that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson’s figures at a time.

## Homework 1
Develop a C++ program that will determine whether a department-store customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. For each customer, the following facts are available:
a) Account number (an integer)
b) Balance at the beginning of the month
c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month
d) Total of all credits applied to this customers account this month
e) Allowed credit limit
The program should use a while statement to input each of these facts, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance + charges – credits) and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit. For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the customer’s account number, credit limit, new balance and the message “Credit Limit Exceeded.”
